# Data Mining Projects
This is a summary of detailed project. Only the Solution and Results are shown.

#Project 1: DATA MINING TECHNIQUE FOR RETAIL INDUSTRY
DESCRIPTION OF SOLUTION: The proposed study is performed in data mining tool ‘Orange’. It is an open source data analysis and visualization tool, which performs data mining through Python scripting and visual programming. Clustering prove beneficial in gaining a broad knowledge of the data. Two clustering algorithm K-means and Hierarchical clustering algorithm is used to compare this study.

RESULT: K-means and Hierarchical clustering having similar features but the cluster is more accurate and objects are more tightly bound in K-means clustering. The centroid in K-means clustering works well while the Euclidean distance metric is not able to measure the distance between two objects in hierarchical clustering.

#Project 2: DATA MINING APPROACH FOR HEART DISEASE PREDICTION
DESCRIPTION OF SOLUTION: This work is performed in two steps. First is data mining and second is machine learning. In this study data mining techniques such as K-means clustering and classification are used in extracting knowledge from database.

RESULT: The most suitable model in building a Heart disease predictor is based on the performance of the machine algorithm. The performance summary is given in Fig 2.17. From Fig 2.17 we can see that DT outperforms all the ML algorithms. DT with train/test ratio of 80:20 has the best predictive accuracy of 93.66%.
